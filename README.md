## How to download this repository ?

1.Got to GitHub.
2.Click the download button.

## How to run the code ?

1.Make sure you have python installed.
2.Open the interpreter and type python "name of the file" eg. python solution-1.py

## What each file contains ?

1.This program calculates the sum of all the numbers between zero and a number entered by a user. The file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-1.py.

2.This program returns an output weather the day of the week begins/not with a letter T. The file inclide code and comments. The name of the file is solution-2.py.

3.This program prints out all the numbers which are divisible by 6 but not by 12 in a specific range. The file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-3.py.

4.This program is about collatz conjencture in mathematics. Collatz conjencture otputs the successive value of the operation, where value is even, it divides it by 2 and if it is odd it multiply it by 3 and add 1. The program ends if the value reaches one. The file include code and comments.the name of the file is solution-4.py.

5.This program checks if the number entered by the user is prime or not.The prime number is a natural number greater than 1, which is divisible by one and itself. This file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-5.py.

6. This file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-6.py.

7. This file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-7.py.

8. This file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-8.py.

9. This file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-9.py.

10. This file include code and comments. The name of the file is solution-10.py.

## Extra information

The problem-set consists of 10 different problems, however I was able to complete only 5 out of 10 by the 31/03/2019 (deadline). This was my first expericence with programming and I overestimated my abilities to fullfill the assignment on time. During the whole process the invalid syntax error appeared all the time. I treid to change indentation or capitalize first letter but it did not work. Sometimes the first valuable eg ''n'' was underlined and no matter the changes it stayed the same. Therefore for some solutions the content of the code may be correct however it cannot be executed in the terminal. I will continue work on this problems set, after the deadline as I can see the progress in my work. Additionally the cmr causes my computer to crash for some reason, the famous Windows Bluescreen pops up and I cannot continue where I finished.
